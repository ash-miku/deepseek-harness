# @deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-brand-official

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## Summary

This package gives the client the DeepSeek Harness mark and name in the sidebar. The occupants register for every build profile, so the sidebar always shows the official wordmark instead of the shell's local-build label; the conversation hero still uses its own animated fish. Choose it for deployments branded as DeepSeek Harness; deployments with another identity should provide a replacement brand package. It has no runtime state and does not affect model requests.

## Use this package

Mount this plugin in the browser roster of a deployment whose identity is DeepSeek's own, then build the client with the `official` profile so the occupants register.

### Brand occupancy

Registration is not profile-gated: the plugin fills the sidebar brand slots for every build profile, so both an `official` build and a local build render the official mark and name. The shell's fish-mark and local-build fallbacks stay declared but are no longer reached. The conversation hero shows the animated hero fish from `dsh-client-ui-conversation` regardless, because that fallback is already the official mark.

### Replacing the brand

A deployment with its own identity leaves this package out and composes another package that occupies the sidebar slots — and the hero slot, which this package leaves on its fallback. Occupying a slot is the only composition route; there is no brand configuration surface here.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The two occupants install as one declaration-aware registration set: nested `ctx.slots.inject()` calls wait on the sidebar declaration, so the set works whether this row activates before or after the declarer, withdraws both occupants when the declaration collapses, and leaves no partial brand mix during HMR. The browser half is [`src/client/index.ts`](src/client/index.ts); the node half is an empty Loader seat. The browser title is a build-environment concern (`DSH_CLIENT_TITLE`), outside the slot system; when no build title is configured the shell falls back to the localized official product name (`brand.productName`).

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the brand surface is not enough. They move from the slots this package occupies to the shell that renders them.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — declares `sidebar.brand.mark` and `sidebar.brand.name` and renders their fallbacks.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — declares `conversation.hero.brand.mark` in the hero.
- [Web client architecture](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-web-client-architecture.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the package contributes browser presentation only; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define how brand presentation is supplied. They are current package constraints, not a brand-design comparison or a task backlog.

- **One occupant set** — alternative presentation belongs in another Cordis package occupying the same slots.
- **The browser title is independent** — `DSH_CLIENT_TITLE` selects title text at build time rather than through a UI slot; an unset value falls back to the localized official product name (`brand.productName`).

### Dev Note

<details>
<summary>Working context for maintainers — click to expand</summary>

None.

</details>

**Runtime invariant:** No companion is published. The package retains no mutable state, and its three slot occupants install and leave through one transactional effect.
